    "answer": "If there is an outstanding balance for the current month and the payment is not received within the stipulated timeline, the primary member will receive a non-payment notice with a 48-hour deadline to make the payment. Failure to do so will result in a late fee charge, calculated according to the percentage specified in your membership agreement, which will be added to the next month's invoice.\n\nIf payment remains outstanding, additional non-payment notices will be sent, which may lead to keycard deactivation or eviction.\n\nThink you were charged a late fee by mistake?\nIf you believe a late payment notice was issued in error and you've already completed the payment, please submit a support request with your bank payment confirmation as proof.",
